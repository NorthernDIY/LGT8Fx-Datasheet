Readme

These files are ones that other people have created but I modified to add a bookmark index.

To Andrew: If you find this, I have renamed your version to ..."1.0.4.0Andrew." I also modified your first page to reflect this label. I added my index and matched your document to all 470 entries as best I could. You have a few small sections missing entirely though. At least I didn't see them within 2-3 minutes of searching pretty hard. I also added the Chinese ending pages that were omitted from the end of yours. You can download this and add anything you would like to the version information label. However I strongly advise you not to relabel the original information from the manufacturer. If I were you I would also take down anything with this "1.0.5" label. Other people will go looking for the source documentation to match it. By modifying the manufacturer's number you're making a statement you probably don't want to make, and creating unnecessary confusion. Add anything you would like to the end of the information the manufacturer provides, and it is easy to understand what the document is and what it is based upon. My final version of my PDF will simply mirror the LGT document's name with "J" appended to the end. -Sincerely

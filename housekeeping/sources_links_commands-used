definitions/commands used - this is raw commented notes prompted by skimming my bash command history just to give you an idea of what's going on.

If you need to compress a pdf the best option I have used so far is:
https://www.sejda.com/compress-pdf
There are a couple of command examples below where I split up the 267 page pdf to pass it through sejda. The site has a 200 page and 100MB limit for files uploaded for compression on the site. Users are also limited to 3 docs per hour.

main image to text tool:    pdfocr.sh
    This is something I found here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gkovacs/pdfocr/master/pdfocr.rb
    I have also included a copy of this file as pdfocr.sh. It has issues and shows errors, but it kinda works.

    sudo chmod 755 pdfocr.sh    #modify the read/write privlages for the bash script 
    sudo mv ~/pdfocr.sh /usr/local/bin/pdfocr.sh    #move the bash script to the root folder so all that we need to type is pdfocr.sh to run the script. 
    
note if you use the pdfocf.sh script and try to run it, it was designed to prompt you if it needs some package that isn't already present on your computer. I think this is the list of everything it asked for.
    sudo apt install ruby
    sudo apt install pdftk          #this is how we manipulate the pdf document, moving pages around and checking data
    sudo apt install unpaper        #unpaper is only used for scanned documents that do not have a digital white background
    sudo apt install tesseract-ocr  #the main program used to extract the text from the .pdf image file
    sudo apt install pdftoppm
    sudo apt install cuneiform      #I couldn't get this one to work, it's an alternative to tesseract-ocr
    sudo apt install exactimage
    sudo apt-get install okular     #a half decent pdf viewer /not needed but is better than the lubuntu default
    
    
    burst = pdftk LGT8FX8P_databook_v1.0.4.en.pdf burst
        This command breaks out each page of the original pdf into it's own single page pdf.
        The "burst" output of the english and chinese datasheets are stored in the burst-en and burst-cn directories.
        The complete datasheet is also inside of the burst-en/-ch folders.

        sudo apt install qpdf
        gedit /usr/share/doc/qpdf/qpdf-manual.pdf #gedit is a basic text editor you can use anything here like vim or whatever
        
        
note I also tried the free version of Master PDF editor, Libre Office Draw, and a couple of online PDF editors. None of them worked very well. Perhaps mentioning it will save you some time.

Directories:
    Burst-Ch
        This contains the original Chinese PDF broken up into individual pages, and a copy of the original.
    Burst-En
        Just like the Chinese one but English.
    Final PDF
        This is the folder for files that have been edited, run through text recognition, and have been compressed. 
    Housekeeping
        My basic toolchain verion info, commands, and notes are saved here .
    todo
        This contains the working files I'm making. They are here if you want or need to revise something.
        
        GIMP XCF
            This directory contains the compressed .xcf GIMP files with all the layers, added text, and makeshift alignment tools I used.
        PDF Image
            These are the flat image files that come out of GIMP when a .xcf file is exported as a PDF.
        PDF OCR Text
            These files are the final uncompressed pages that will go into the final PDF
            
NOTE: The process I am using has evolved over the first 10 pages. The upload resolutions and sizing were wrong for the first 8 pages. The final product PDF files have been modified. However, if you use the .xcf files from these pages the output is totally wrong. Instead of losing all the layer information and ability to revise the text, I kept the files as is. Correcting the resolution involves exporting the incorrect PDF, then opening this pdf in gimp. I then scale the layer to 150ppi x 150ppi. After this I size the image to the layer. This should be the same resolution as everything else. My upload resolution for later pages is 150ppi and A4 (aka 8.268in x 11.692in). I also use some painted and drawn layers for text alignment. Be sure you do not include these in an exported final PDF.
